# Problem Statement and Motivation:

An efficient road network plays an essential role in determining the quality of life of the people living in a city. As a city grows, the number of vehicles grow and its transportation network expands to serve the needs of the people. But in densely populated cities the scope for expansion is minimal. Often we are in a situation where we have to maximize the potential of what is already available. Road Networks are affected by a lot of factors that positively/negatively impact its efficiency. These factors depend on the complexity of the activities that happen in the city.

* How do we define the efficiency of a Road Network?
* By how much do each of these inefficiency factors reduce the efficiency of the Road Network?

These questions would help in prioritizing the investments and planning decisions that are needed to improve the efficiency of the road networks.

Through this analysis I intend to explore some of the factors that visibly affect the Road Networks and quantitative impact they have on them.
