# Data:
1) New York City Streetlines:
 * A complete network of roads in NYC in a shapefile represented by Linestrings

2) NYC Potholes:
 * Complete Data of the Potholes that were identified and resolved between 2004 to 2016
 * This data is in the form of a shapefile and the potholes are tagged by Linestrings of Roads. Anomalies exist, which I will discuss later.
 * An alternative to this would be to use the Data from Argo Labs which would give a snapshot of current status rather than the past.
 * Varun has suggested me to use the Open data for the time being and I would try and update this part of the data in the future
